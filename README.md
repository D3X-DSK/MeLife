# MeLife
A passion project of MeLife and the Epicenter, the app from Inanimate insanity! All made in Xcode with SwiftUI (P.S Don't mind the second page on the MeLife app, I was supposed to add all the contestants but gave up)
# Minimum Requirements!
Melife: iOS - 15.6 (Has been tested on a iPhone 11 running iOS 18-26)
MeLife Epicenter: iPadOS 15.5 (Has been tested on an iPad Pro 10.5" 2017 running iPadOS 17.7.7)
# How It works!
It's just a regular Xcode app I made in January, and in June made the Epicenter, I have only tested it one those devices seen in the requirements so if there is any issues please add it to the Issues area as I would like to give this app to the public to have fun with, I love Inanimate Insanity and would love to see what the fandom will do with this!
# How To install It!
As it's an IPA it requires some knowledge, a PC/Mac and 3uTools/Sideloadly to sign and inject the IPA (Or your preferred IPA Injector), I won't go into how to install it as there's many guides for it and I am lazy
# Credit!
Please credit me if you end up using it in a video! I go by @d3x.dsk on TikTok, I wanna see what the II fandom does with this!
